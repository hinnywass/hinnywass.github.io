      <title>Finding Support Within</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this week’s classes we’ve been working with the intent of finding the support you need inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using two simple actions, grounding down and taking a full breath, it’s possible to tap into an internal strength which can help you through any challenges you face.  This might be a yoga pose, or a delayed train, or an argument, or grief, or just the mild trauma of Sainsbury’s on a Saturday.  Whatever the adversity, this simple formula can help you respond as your wiser self, and connect to your immense internal strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you feel in need of support, begin by sending your focus into all the parts of your body which are in contact with the ground.  Fully feel what it is to be supported by the earth.
Then take a full, soft, feeling breath into your low belly.  Nourish yourself with your breath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you exhale, feel for letting go of anything that’s not useful to you - that might be tension in your shoulders or belly, or self-mutilating talk, or an old story you tell yourself about your limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use this several times a day, and find it’s immensely helpful.  Hope you do too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Fifteen minute sequence for... shoulders</title>
      <link>http://www.hinnywassyoga.co.uk/blog/2017-07-03-fifteen-minute-shoulders/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tight neck and shoulders?  Then this one’s for you!  This is pretty much exactly my own practice when I don’t have much time in the morning - it works brilliantly to ease out the stiffness I wake up with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go cautiously if you have any kind of neck injury or pain.  Don’t do anything that hurts - listen carefully to the signals your body’s giving you - and stretch to just 80% of your capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are pregnant then you can do all of this sequence except you will need to miss out the abs exercise.  Be careful not to put any pressure on the baby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout this 15 minute sequence, send your inhale into anything that feels tense, tight or stuck, and use your exhale to release whatever you’re ready to let go of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Side bend and neck release, breathing into neck
Baddhakonasana forward bend, breathing into low back
Abs with a block/roll (4-6 rounds)
Dolphin prelude
Turbo puppy
Dolphin
Horse:  Shoulder shrugs &amp;gt; Birdwing
Warrior 2: eagle &amp;gt; archer &amp;gt; ostrich (left side first, then repeat on right side)
Shower on the Wall
Neck release (sit on fingertips of left hand and relax head towards right shoulder, other arm comes up and over, with fingertips on jawline)
Savasana&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with any of these short sequences, if you want to do a longer practice then you can add in a few rounds of Sun Salutations after Dolphin.  If you’re in the mood for an inversion, then after you’ve done Shower you’ll be warm enough to do Dolphin on the Wall or a forearm balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope it helps you as much as it helps me!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Swallows</title>
      <link>http://www.hinnywassyoga.co.uk/blog/2017-06-28-swallows/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every Forrest Yoga class has an intent, a theme which runs through the class.  Last week in lots of the classes I taught we were working with the intent of being more like swallows.  This is less crazy than it sounds.  I live by the river and so recently I’ve had the great pleasure of being able to watch the beautiful seal-bellied swallows catching insects just above the surface of the water with astonishing speed and agility, changing direction in an instant and looking so effortless.  It struck me that they are intricately intertwined with their environment; their flight is shaped equally by their intended goal and the air currents they are interacting with.  There is no sense that they are fighting the situation they find themselves in - they are simply navigating what is, with ease and grace, and reacting quickly and smoothly to changes.  This is very different to my habitual reaction to change and challenge, and I suspect I’m not alone in that.  In transition from one situation to another I am much more likely to resist, to hold onto the familiar and fight the new, to be weighed down with old habits which are no longer useful.  So in my classes and in my own practice I’ve been exploring how it feels to jettison the heavy luggage and to seek ease and grace in change.  So far it’s tricky but very rewarding, and an exercise I can definitely recommend.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fifteen minute sequence for... hips</title>
      <link>http://www.hinnywassyoga.co.uk/blog/2017-06-11-fifteen-minute-hips/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Are your hips tight, stiff, tweaky?  Or do you just want to bring in some sparkling fresh energy to your lower body?  Then here’s a fifteen minute practice just for you!  These are all poses we’ve done in class, but if you can’t remember what one looks like then you can google it, or head to the photo gallery on www.forrestyoga.com.  This sequence is not suitable for anyone who is pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pelvic floor and the sacral joint (where the spine meets the pelvis), when active, both act as pumps to help move lymph and clear out what the body doesn’t need (like, for example, the sticky, clogging fibrin which results from long-term stress and inflammation).  If we spend our lives sitting down then these pumps aren’t activated and things can get a bit swampy, so Forrest Yoga can really help here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout your practice send your breath into your hips.  On inhale gently bear down into the pelvic floor, and on exhale feel for drawing the pelvic floor just a little up towards your belly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, work to only 80% of your capacity, and don’t stretch into pain or do anything that your body doesn’t like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relaxing the Neck, legs in Baddhakonasana (BK)
Unlocking the Hips (two stages)
BK forward bend
Frog Lifting Through (4 to 6 rounds)
*
Warrior 2, left foot forward, Shoulder Shrugs &amp;gt; Head to Ankle Prep &amp;gt; Lounge Lunge &amp;gt; Pigeon&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transition through down dog and repeat from * on the other side, right foot forward this time.
Happy Baby
Savasana&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to do a longer practice then you can add in a few rounds of Sun Salutations after Frog Lifting Through. After Pigeon on the second side you can add in a pose like Pin Feather or Archeopteryx Prelude if you fancy a juicy apex pose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What is Forrest Yoga?</title>
      <link>http://www.hinnywassyoga.co.uk/blog/2017-05-09-what-is-forrest-yoga/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Forrest Yoga is a modern form of yoga created by Ana Forrest, which is designed to ease the aches and ailments of modern life.  Today’s average Western human being spends most of her life sitting down, hunched over a screen or a steering wheel, and most likely in a state of chronic stress which has become normal.  Combine that with the average Western diet, seriously lacking in Omega-3 oils and plants, and rich in inflammation-inducing refined carbohydrates, and the result is a lot of people who feel at least a bit rubbish most of the time.  Forrest Yoga combines breath and movement to stretch out the tight, short muscles, strengthen the long, weak ones, and bring feeling and awareness back into the parts of the body which have become numbed out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Forrest practice also calms the body out of stress.  When a person perceives a threat the body readies itself for the kind of intense burst of activity needed to fight or run away.  The muscles of the neck and around the collarbones tighten and the breathing moves into the top of the chest, in order to drag air more quickly into the lungs.  Blood flow is directed away from the digestive organs and the brain.  This works brilliantly, as long as running or fighting is the appropriate response.  More often, though, it’s not what we need at all, and we are left facing an impending deadline or a disagreement with a friend with shallow breath, a muzzy head and a tummy ache.  Unfortunately humans also have a design flaw, in that, in sensing that the neck is tight and breathing is high in the chest, the body concludes that there must be a reason to be stressed and so it goes round and round in a feedback loop.  The very useful hormone cortisol stops being helpful if it’s not just an occasional thing, and after weeks or months of the body being stuck in fight-or-flight it can lead to inflammation (which has been linked to depression, allergies, asthma, skin problems etc etc etc).  By bringing the breath low in the belly, by relaxing the neck and shoulders, and by stretching out the muscles around the top of the chest, Forrest Yoga can help break the stress-loop and send a message to the nervous system that everything is fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forrest Yoga begins with the assumption that pretty much everyone has some kind of scar tissue, whether physical scar tissue from injuries, or calcification around a muscle which has been held in tension for a long, long time, or emotional scar tissue, where past trauma is locked into the body.  So a Forrest class always meets a student where they are at right now today, and always aims to help that student heal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s more, Forrest students learn to practise in a way that is free from pain (or pain-freeing) and free from struggle.  That’s not to say that Forrest Yoga isn’t a strong practice - it encourages you to work hard!  You will sweat.  And if you practise regularly you will get strong, like really strong.  But you will get there by working at your edge with integrity, by honouring your body’s needs and its subtlest signals, and by asking yourself, every time you practise, ‘What part of this can I do right now?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you go deeper into your Forrest Yoga practice, you’ll find that you can listen more and more carefully to what you are feeling, not only while you’re on your mat but in the rest of life too.  You’ll probably find that you’re eating better, as you engage more fully with what you’re feeling at mealtimes.  You might also be sleeping better, feeling more energised, enjoying better sex, engaging more positively with other people, and finding challenges easier to cope with.  As you listen more and more carefully to your body-mind, you might also begin to be aware of your triggers - the things which push you into a habitual fear or anger response - and be able to find new, healthier, ways of responding to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all these ways, Forrest Yoga helps you break down the things which cage you in: physical discomfort, emotional distress, trauma locked into your body, your old stories about yourself, and the habitual learned responses which might once have kept you safe but which are now limiting you.  It’s a deeply exciting journey.  Are you ready to begin your transformation?&lt;/p&gt;
