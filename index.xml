      <title>Finding Support Within</title>
      <link>http://www.hinnywassyoga.co.uk/blog/2017-07-05-finding-support-within/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this week’s classes we’ve been working with the intent of finding the support you need inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using two simple actions, grounding down and taking a full breath, it’s possible to tap into an internal strength which can help you through any challenges you face.  This might be a yoga pose, or a delayed train, or an argument, or grief, or just the mild trauma of Sainsbury’s on a Saturday.  Whatever the adversity, this simple formula can help you respond as your wiser self, and connect to your immense internal strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you feel in need of support, begin by sending your focus into all the parts of your body which are in contact with the ground.  Fully feel what it is to be supported by the earth.
Then take a full, soft, feeling breath into your low belly.  Nourish yourself with your breath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you exhale, feel for letting go of anything that’s not useful to you - that might be tension in your shoulders or belly, or self-mutilating talk, or an old story you tell yourself about your limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use this several times a day, and find it’s immensely helpful.  Hope you do too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Fifteen minute sequence for... shoulders</title>
      <link>http://www.hinnywassyoga.co.uk/blog/2017-07-03-fifteen-minute-shoulders/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tight neck and shoulders?  Then this one’s for you!  This is pretty much exactly my own practice when I don’t have much time in the morning - it works brilliantly to ease out the stiffness I wake up with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go cautiously if you have any kind of neck injury or pain.  Don’t do anything that hurts - listen carefully to the signals your body’s giving you - and stretch to just 80% of your capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are pregnant then you can do all of this sequence except you will need to miss out the abs exercise.  Be careful not to put any pressure on the baby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout this 15 minute sequence, send your inhale into anything that feels tense, tight or stuck, and use your exhale to release whatever you’re ready to let go of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Side bend and neck release, breathing into neck
Baddhakonasana forward bend, breathing into low back
Abs with a block/roll (4-6 rounds)
Dolphin prelude
Turbo puppy
Dolphin
Horse:  Shoulder shrugs &amp;gt; Birdwing
Warrior 2: eagle &amp;gt; archer &amp;gt; ostrich (left side first, then repeat on right side)
Shower on the Wall
Neck release (sit on fingertips of left hand and relax head towards right shoulder, other arm comes up and over, with fingertips on jawline)
Savasana&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with any of these short sequences, if you want to do a longer practice then you can add in a few rounds of Sun Salutations after Dolphin.  If you’re in the mood for an inversion, then after you’ve done Shower you’ll be warm enough to do Dolphin on the Wall or a forearm balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope it helps you as much as it helps me!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Swallows</title>
      <link>http://www.hinnywassyoga.co.uk/blog/2017-06-28-swallows/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 28 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.hinnywassyoga.co.uk/blog/2017-06-28-swallows/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every Forrest Yoga class has an intent, a theme which runs through the class.  Last week in lots of the classes I taught we were working with the intent of being more like swallows.  This is less crazy than it sounds.  I live by the river and so recently I’ve had the great pleasure of being able to watch the beautiful seal-bellied swallows catching insects just above the surface of the water with astonishing speed and agility, changing direction in an instant and looking so effortless.  It struck me that they are intricately intertwined with their environment; their flight is shaped equally by their intended goal and the air currents they are interacting with.  There is no sense that they are fighting the situation they find themselves in - they are simply navigating what is, with ease and grace, and reacting quickly and smoothly to changes.  This is very different to my habitual reaction to change and challenge, and I suspect I’m not alone in that.  In transition from one situation to another I am much more likely to resist, to hold onto the familiar and fight the new, to be weighed down with old habits which are no longer useful.  So in my classes and in my own practice I’ve been exploring how it feels to jettison the heavy luggage and to seek ease and grace in change.  So far it’s tricky but very rewarding, and an exercise I can definitely recommend.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fifteen minute sequence for... hips</title>
      <link>http://www.hinnywassyoga.co.uk/blog/2017-06-11-fifteen-minute-hips/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 11 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.hinnywassyoga.co.uk/blog/2017-06-11-fifteen-minute-hips/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Are your hips tight, stiff, tweaky?  Or do you just want to bring in some sparkling fresh energy to your lower body?  Then here’s a fifteen minute practice just for you!  These are all poses we’ve done in class, but if you can’t remember what one looks like then you can google it, or head to the photo gallery on www.forrestyoga.com.  This sequence is not suitable for anyone who is pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pelvic floor and the sacral joint (where the spine meets the pelvis), when active, both act as pumps to help move lymph and clear out what the body doesn’t need (like, for example, the sticky, clogging fibrin which results from long-term stress and inflammation).  If we spend our lives sitting down then these pumps aren’t activated and things can get a bit swampy, so Forrest Yoga can really help here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout your practice send your breath into your hips.  On inhale gently bear down into the pelvic floor, and on exhale feel for drawing the pelvic floor just a little up towards your belly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, work to only 80% of your capacity, and don’t stretch into pain or do anything that your body doesn’t like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relaxing the Neck, legs in Baddhakonasana (BK)
Unlocking the Hips (two stages)
BK forward bend
Frog Lifting Through (4 to 6 rounds)
*
Warrior 2, left foot forward, Shoulder Shrugs &amp;gt; Head to Ankle Prep &amp;gt; Lounge Lunge &amp;gt; Pigeon&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transition through down dog and repeat from * on the other side, right foot forward this time.
Happy Baby
Savasana&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to do a longer practice then you can add in a few rounds of Sun Salutations after Frog Lifting Through. After Pigeon on the second side you can add in a pose like Pin Feather or Archeopteryx Prelude if you fancy a juicy apex pose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you decide that you&#39;d like to come to class regularly, then you might want to consider buying a block of classes to save money.  For classes at SOCC and in Stanton Harcourt you can buy a six-class card, and for Jam Factory lunchtime classes you can buy a ten-class card.  These cards are valid for six months, so you don&#39;t need to worry if you can&#39;t make it every week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find Hinny Wass Yoga on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/hinnywassyoga/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; or on Twitter @YogaHinny and say hullo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;forrest-yoga&#34;&gt;Forrest Yoga&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;forrest&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forrest Yoga has been developed by Ana Forrest to counteract the discomforts of modern life, such as the aches and ailments caused by extended sitting and hunching over computers, devices and steering wheels.  In Forrest Yoga movement and breath are linked together to calm the mind and body, develop strength and confidence, and track feeling throughout the body.  Classes are warm, sweaty, fun and safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hinny first discovered Forrest Yoga in 2011, when she began attending classes run by Forrest Yoga Guardian Jambo Truong in Newcastle.  She fell in love with Forrest Yoga immediately.  Not only did the classes help ease chronic tension in her shoulders and neck, and bring her mind to a calm place, but they also showed her that she was capable of much more than she had ever imagined.  Plus she always came out of class feeling amazing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After moving to Oxford, Hinny missed Jambo&amp;rsquo;s classes and the Forrest Yoga community so much that she decided she would have to build something similar in her new city.  In October 2016 she travelled to Texas for a month-long intensive Forrest Yoga teacher training course, run by Guardians Cat Allen and Heidi Sormaz, and is now a Level One certified Forrest Yoga teacher.  She is very excited to share with you the myriad benefits of this wonderful form of yoga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find out more about Forrest Yoga visit &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.forrestyoga.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;forrestyoga.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you come to class, wear comfy clothes that you can stretch in, and bring a bottle of water.  Mats and props are provided, but you can bring your own if you prefer.  Yoga is best on an empty belly, so don&amp;rsquo;t eat in the 90 minutes before class. Email &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:hinny@hinnywassyoga.co.uk&#34;&gt;hinny@hinnywassyoga.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; to book your place, or just turn up.  If it&amp;rsquo;s your first class, come a little early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;lunchtime-office-escape&#34;&gt;Lunchtime Office Escape&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;lunchtime&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beat the afternoon slump, boost your brainpower and cheer yourself up with a half-hour lunchtime yoga class!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human bodies need movement in order to function well.  Movement like yoga helps lubricate joints, helps the body eliminate toxins by getting lymph moving, keeps breathing full and so helps feed the body and brain with oxygen, and helps calm stress.  If you don&amp;rsquo;t move then you can end up feeling tired, irritable, stressed and achey, so come along to class!  You can spend half an hour giving your body what it needs, then get some lunch and return to work refreshed.  In class you will also learn techniques that you can use every day to keep your mind fresh and your body healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The class won&amp;rsquo;t be a hot and sweaty one, but you will need comfy clothes you can stretch in (not your work suit!).  Mats and props provided.  Yoga is best done with an empty belly, so eat lunch afterwards, rather than before.  Limited space at the Jam Factory, so email &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:hinny@hinnywassyoga.co.uk&#34;&gt;hinny@hinnywassyoga.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; to book your place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;free-classes-at-grandpont-family-room&#34;&gt;Free Classes at Grandpont Family Room&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;grandpont&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Starting at the end of April, Hinny will be running a series of fifteen free yoga classes at Grandpont Family Room, in collaboration with the new volunteer-led children&amp;rsquo;s services in South Oxford.  Priority will be given to local parents with no or low income.  The classes will be Forrest Yoga sequences which aim to stretch and strengthen the body and calm the mind.  All mats and props are provided, so you don&amp;rsquo;t need to bring anything except maybe a bottle of water.  Wear stretchy, comfy clothes, like leggings or jogging bottoms and a T-shirt.  If you&amp;rsquo;d like to book a place then email &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:hinny@hinnywassyoga.co.uk&#34;&gt;hinny@hinnywassyoga.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;private-lessons&#34;&gt;Private Lessons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;private&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Hinny also offers one-to-one tuition in your home.  You just need to provide a warm room with space for two yoga mats, and Hinny can bring everything else you&amp;rsquo;ll need.  For prices and more information email &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:hinny@hinnywassyoga.co.uk&#34;&gt;hinny@hinnywassyoga.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private lessons are excellent for: those who prefer practising yoga at home rather than in public classes; those who can&amp;rsquo;t find a class at a time that suits them; and people who have a particular injury or issue they want to address.  A private lesson offers you the chance of asking as many questions as you like, and of receiving focussed, detailed guidance in your yoga practice, plus lots of hands-on assists to help you find best alignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;yoga-for-violinists&#34;&gt;Yoga for Violinists&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;violinists&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Are you a violinst or viola player?  Do you seek more resonant tone, more freedom of creative expression, better posture, a way to heal aches and pains or rehab injuries, a path away from performance anxiety and self-mutilating voices, or a happier relationship with your instrument?  If you answered yes to any of the above then this workshop is for you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hinny is a violin teacher of ten years&amp;rsquo; experience. She began learning the violin at age three, and in the intervening decades has discovered the absolute joy of making music.  She has also come to experience, at various times, the discomforts associated with being a violinist: the aches and pains from long hours spent practising; the endless striving for a better sound and the frustration when it doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen; performance anxiety and self doubt; the pressures associated with learning and working in a competitive environment.  When Hinny discovered Forrest Yoga she found something which has helped to counteract all of these things, and she began to find even more joy and contentment in playing the violin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having now become a certified yoga teacher, Hinny is in the wonderful position of being able to share this discovery with other violinists and viola players.  In these specialist workshops, Forrest-inspired yoga sequences are combined with tone and resonance exercises.  The links between posture, mindset and sound are explored, to help you break through the physical and mental barriers to unrestrained musical expression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would like Hinny to run a half or full day workshop in your local area, for your orchestra or fiddle group, at your university&amp;rsquo;s music department, or for your group of friends then please email &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:hinny@hinnywassyoga.co.uk&#34;&gt;hinny@hinnywassyoga.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What is Forrest Yoga?</title>
      <link>http://www.hinnywassyoga.co.uk/blog/2017-05-09-what-is-forrest-yoga/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 09 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.hinnywassyoga.co.uk/blog/2017-05-09-what-is-forrest-yoga/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Forrest Yoga is a modern form of yoga created by Ana Forrest, which is designed to ease the aches and ailments of modern life.  Today’s average Western human being spends most of her life sitting down, hunched over a screen or a steering wheel, and most likely in a state of chronic stress which has become normal.  Combine that with the average Western diet, seriously lacking in Omega-3 oils and plants, and rich in inflammation-inducing refined carbohydrates, and the result is a lot of people who feel at least a bit rubbish most of the time.  Forrest Yoga combines breath and movement to stretch out the tight, short muscles, strengthen the long, weak ones, and bring feeling and awareness back into the parts of the body which have become numbed out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Forrest practice also calms the body out of stress.  When a person perceives a threat the body readies itself for the kind of intense burst of activity needed to fight or run away.  The muscles of the neck and around the collarbones tighten and the breathing moves into the top of the chest, in order to drag air more quickly into the lungs.  Blood flow is directed away from the digestive organs and the brain.  This works brilliantly, as long as running or fighting is the appropriate response.  More often, though, it’s not what we need at all, and we are left facing an impending deadline or a disagreement with a friend with shallow breath, a muzzy head and a tummy ache.  Unfortunately humans also have a design flaw, in that, in sensing that the neck is tight and breathing is high in the chest, the body concludes that there must be a reason to be stressed and so it goes round and round in a feedback loop.  The very useful hormone cortisol stops being helpful if it’s not just an occasional thing, and after weeks or months of the body being stuck in fight-or-flight it can lead to inflammation (which has been linked to depression, allergies, asthma, skin problems etc etc etc).  By bringing the breath low in the belly, by relaxing the neck and shoulders, and by stretching out the muscles around the top of the chest, Forrest Yoga can help break the stress-loop and send a message to the nervous system that everything is fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forrest Yoga begins with the assumption that pretty much everyone has some kind of scar tissue, whether physical scar tissue from injuries, or calcification around a muscle which has been held in tension for a long, long time, or emotional scar tissue, where past trauma is locked into the body.  So a Forrest class always meets a student where they are at right now today, and always aims to help that student heal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s more, Forrest students learn to practise in a way that is free from pain (or pain-freeing) and free from struggle.  That’s not to say that Forrest Yoga isn’t a strong practice - it encourages you to work hard!  You will sweat.  And if you practise regularly you will get strong, like really strong.  But you will get there by working at your edge with integrity, by honouring your body’s needs and its subtlest signals, and by asking yourself, every time you practise, ‘What part of this can I do right now?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you go deeper into your Forrest Yoga practice, you’ll find that you can listen more and more carefully to what you are feeling, not only while you’re on your mat but in the rest of life too.  You’ll probably find that you’re eating better, as you engage more fully with what you’re feeling at mealtimes.  You might also be sleeping better, feeling more energised, enjoying better sex, engaging more positively with other people, and finding challenges easier to cope with.  As you listen more and more carefully to your body-mind, you might also begin to be aware of your triggers - the things which push you into a habitual fear or anger response - and be able to find new, healthier, ways of responding to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all these ways, Forrest Yoga helps you break down the things which cage you in: physical discomfort, emotional distress, trauma locked into your body, your old stories about yourself, and the habitual learned responses which might once have kept you safe but which are now limiting you.  It’s a deeply exciting journey.  Are you ready to begin your transformation?&lt;/p&gt;
